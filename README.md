This project presents the design, hardware implementation, and testing of a path finder 
vehicle using an ARM-based STM32F411CEU6 microcontroller (Blackpill board). The 
vehicle autonomously follows a line path using three IR sensors, navigated by BO motors 
(via L298N dual H-bridge motor driver), with real-time feedback on an LCD display (I2C). 
The system is powered by a 11.1V Li-ion battery 

## Components:
- STM32F411CEU6 100 MHz ARM Cortex-M4, 512 KB Main microcontroller 
- ST-link V2 USB interface, ARM debug support Programmer/debugger 
- IR Sensors 3 pcs, digital output Path sensing 
- LCD I2C 16x2 HD44780, I2C backpack Status display 
- BO Motors Dual shaft, 100 RPM, 6V–12V Vehicle drive 
- L298N Driver Dual H-bridge, 2A per channel Motor control 
- Li-ion Battery 11.1V nominal Power to all circuits

## Environment:
STM32CubeIDE

## Working Principle
The robot uses three IR sensors to detect a black line on a white surface.  
- If the center sensor detects the line → move straight.  
- If the left sensor detects the line → turn left.  
- If the right sensor detects the line → turn right.  
Motor speeds are controlled using PWM signals generated by TIM2 and TIM3 peripherals.
